Evidence strongly suggests that many elections owe their victories to electronic tampering. <br />
Restoring accurate counting will strengthen the moderate middle and reduce gridlock in

Free and fair elections are a core principle of democracy. <br />They hold leaders accountable and are

							<h3>The Problem</h3>
							<p>Ballot box stuffing, vote stealing, vote switching and other electoral frauds are crimes against
democracy. They rob citizens of their right to choose their government. Government loses its
accountability to the governed, and the disfranchised suffer a slow brownout of their hopes and
aspirations. Apathy increases and injustice flourishes.</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section class="spotlight">
						<div class="image"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></div>
						<div class="content">
							<h3>The Solution</h3>
							<p>The VeriCount Election Audit System TM empowers citizens to watchdog their elections and
expose fraud when it occurs. Simple-to-use phone and tablet apps are built atop a powerful vote
recording and reporting system that stores its data on a robust public blockchain ledger. Citizen
auditors - activists, poll watchers, exit surveyors, election monitors and voters – record and
securely upload data at every stage of the electoral process. The data becomes available for
viewing immediately after the polls close. </p>

					</section>
					<section class="spotlight">
						<div class="image"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></div>
						<div class="content">
							<h3>The Effect</h3>
							<p>The effect of this multiple-stream, real-time audit approach is that, for the first time, it will be
possible for monitors to collect detailed, high-quality direct evidence of the type required for court
challenges. In the event that discrepancies between official results and the VeriCount data point
to potential fraud, audit groups will be immediately able to
 Confidently inform government, campaigns and the media of the potential irregularities,
thereby setting the stage for a delay in certification of election results, and
 Go into court immediately with the clear and convincing evidence required to enjoin
certification and order an investigation of the official system and its data..</p>

						<h2>How VeriCount works</h2>
					</header>

					<section>
						<header>
							<h4>The VeriCount apps are built upon a vote recording and reporting system called Votabit <sup>TM</sup>.</h4>
						</header>
						<p>The Votabit software provides functions for voting, recording, counting and end-to-end verification. 
                            <br />All data is stored transparently: It is uploaded onto a public ledger system called a blockchain, where
anyone with the open-source software can examine it. And it is permanent: Once recorded, all
data, including user-verified photographs and screen shots of ballots, tallies and other evidence,
cannot be deleted or lost. <br /> And it is extremely resistant to fraud: The system’s fraud-detection protocols provide the ability to quickly detect and respond to hacks, which cannot be hidden
because of the nature of the blockchain technology</p>

						<p>All digital and photographic data are time and location stamped and cryptographically secured
using NSA-strength algorithms. Voter identities and their votes are anonymized. After the polls
close, the private key to the citizen-generated data is transmitted, allowing instantaneous display
of the detailed data collected. Because the data is time- and location-stamped, pre- and postelection
alterations are impossible to hide.</p>

<p>There are five apps: The poll-watcher app allows poll watchers to duplicate all the tallies collected
by official poll workers, creating an independent record and thus revealing any post-polling
tampering. The exit survey app allows voters, upon departing their polling places, to re-record
their votes, providing a 1:1 parallel count of the votes cast. The entering-voter app works
similarly, but for places where, because of insufficient polling places, voters are forced to stand in
line for many hours and may be at risk of leaving before casting their votes. The absentee voter
app allows voters to re-record their absentee ballot choices. The election-observer app allows
independent election monitors to upload photographs of suspicious activities that may affect the
conditions surrounding campaigning and voting.</p>

						<h2>The Progress</h2>
					</header>

					<section>
						<header>
							<h4>The VeriCount apps are built upon a vote recording and reporting system called Votabit <sup>TM</sup>.</h4>
						</header>
						<p>We have prototyped one app and are well along in building the cryptographically secure and
transparent real-time accounting and storage components of Votabit. Our goal is to roll out the
exit-survey and poll-watcher apps in time for use in the American presidential election on
November 8, 2016. Shortly afterwards we will release all audit apps to the world and begin
spearheading the creation of an International Federation of Election Auditors.</p>

						<p>Because so many software-literate people care about the direction democracies are going, we
will use crowdsourcing to test and validate the final code. This will save several hundred
thousand dollars and take many months off the process. </p>

<p>In 2017 we will begin development of a voting system, for use by government for official elections.
Called SolidVoteTM, and based on the same Votabit engine as VeriCount, its use will make
internal audits easy and render external audits such as VeriCount unnecessary. </p>

<p>We will release the code under a standard such as Creative Commons for free use by democracy
activists and make licenses very cheap for nonprofit organizations and developing country
governments. We will charge corporate prices to businesses and rich governments to underwrite
the free and cheap licenses above.</p>

<p>We are seeking support. Please visit <a href="http://www.democracycounts.org">www.democracycounts.org</a></p>
